1. Parsing & Extracting methods from javac commands
2. Performance issue while reading input stream of javac command for every .class file(time consuming)
   Solution: Used Process builder command for multiple .class file and dumped the o/p to a single file & read the file at last.
3. Problem to find the starting of class(compiled from .java info is not listing for few class file), here logic is failed.
4. Finally used the com.sun.tools.classfile.ClassFile & com.sun.tools.classfile.ConstantPool to fetch all the method details.
   Understanding and Extracting methods from constant pool is challenging. Using this we are not depending on javac command.
5. Extracting .class file from jar, war and ear is difficult. Recursively unzip all the jar,war & ear till .class file to temp folder, read the information of .class file using constant pool. At last recursively delete all the .class files and folder.
